    <h2>DEF CON 22: Crypto and Privacy Village</h2>
  <p style="width:400px;">For the first time ever, weâ€™re having a Crypto and Privacy Village at DEF CON. Here you can learn how to secure your own systems, while also picking up some tips and tricks on how to break classical and modern encryption. The Crypto and Privacy Village will feature workshops on everything from GPG to FOIA, code sprints on security tools, crypto-related games, and talks on privacy from EFF staffers and more.</p>
