          Yet this key/value data store from the 80’s is insecure and increasingly prone to censorship.  We have had the tools needed to make DNS cryptographically verifiable and decentralized for some time but the initial implementations failed.  Thankfully, after years of research and trial-and-error, we finally have practical and deployable solutions.<br/><br/>
          
          This talk covers the benefits a cryptographically verifiable domain name system and the state of decentralized DNS. It debunks common myths about DNSSEC and explains why it is vital to a decentralized DNS. It finishes with an overview of Namecoin, outlining past challenges that have stymied widespread adoption and potential solutions.</td>

Releasing code for an intentionally flawed encryption implementation or a design for a system that appears to be secure, but in fact allows an attacker to easily recover secret data - this pushes the limits of doing more harm than good, yet is critically important for defenders. Without solid research into how systems could be effectively and efficiently backdoored, defenders quickly fall behind, giving clever attackers a strong upper hand. Defenders, those charged with reviewing code and designs may be able to easily detect the cliched sending emails with credit card numbers, but how prepared are they for a better class of attacker?

In this talk, I’ll sketch out a potential solution (and what I believe NSA/FBI wants to implement, based on their public statements) using public key cryptography, threshold secret sharing, and cryptographic hardware.

Current applications include ranking items in social media feeds, optimizing advertisements, and surveillance and predictive policing by government and law enforcement. This talk will discuss some of the potential ethical and privacy issues associated with the widespread use of machine earning algorithms. Most suffer from a lack of transparency in their design and operation. Mass social engineering is feasible through the use of individualized messages crafted by adaptive algorithms. Subtle manipulation would be very difficult to detect by individuals but can have significant social impact. In addition, biases in input datasets used for training algorithms treated as impartial can systematize discrimination against certain populations. Faced with these challenges, some potential avenues for ameliorating these problems will be discussed, both in terms of policy and technology. As a community, we need to better understand and monitor the role of these methods in society in order to ensure that we build and support systems that are resistant to misuse.

Unfortunately, most of  the public-key cryptography widely used on the Internet today - including RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography - is based on the presumed hardness of these exact problems. In this talk, I introduce quantum computation and the practical realities it will have on popular cryptosystems - both technically, as well as from the perspective of a variety of use cases. From here, I introduce the new mathematics we're currently building to replace RSA in a post-quantum world, and the entirely new cryptanalytic tools we'll need to use to construct it.

          <td>We seldom see incremental trade-offs offered between privacy and other qualities in online services. Many markets are dominated by large firms offering services for "free" and in exchange for personal data. There are less popular offerings in the other extreme, providing privacy and anonymity in exchange for lower performance and convenience. Offerings in between the two extremes are not common, despite post-Snowden surveys showing that a third of consumers find privacy very important.  The absence of services to fill this market gap is puzzling. I hypothesize that a number of fundamental economic reasons make it hard for commercial, privacy-enhanced services to compete with the two extremes on scale. These include: difficulty in trusting privacy claims, the usefulness of data in designing and securing services, network effects, and the high value of targeted ads. In economic terms these induce market failures and if proven have regulatory consequences, for instance with regards to competition law.  I am embarking on new research in this area, and would like to present the idea to privacy enthusiasts, coders, and entrepreneurs producing privacy-preserving services to receive input for my research.</td>

Retiring due to injury, he then began a 25 year career in engineering that included work in consumer, military, and designing utility substation security systems.<br/><br/>
          
          Dr. Carlson returned to school at the University of Idaho in 2002.  There he completed his Master’s degree and PhD, both in Computer Science and specializing in Advance Set Theory and Cryptography. His dissertation, accepted in June of 2012, had as its’ subject: applying Set Theoretic Estimation to decryption. <br/><br/>
          
          In 2013 Dr. Carlson joined the faculty of Fontbonne University on the staff of the Math and Computer Science department.  His research team studies the use of patterns in natural language and how they relate to set and information based attacks on ciphers. Dr. Carlson’s research interests include: cryptography, set theoretic estimation, natural language, patterns in language, physical security, critical infrastructure protection, and hardware security. <br/><br/>

          <td>Hiding patterns in encrypted messages to make the transmission look like random symbols is the goal of cryptography.  However, all ciphers do not completely disguise those patterns, making decryption possible.  In response to this problem, modes were introduced to break up patterns and to increase the “randomness” of an encrypted message. In the case of Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC) the randomizing material is the cipher text from the preceding block. CBC uses a “feed forward” algorithm and a regular structure that provides attackable data.  In fact, there is so much information in the structure and associated data that CBC wrapped around ANY cipher can be efficiently broken.<br/><br/>
          
          We show that by using the blocks of the CBC algorithm both linear and non-linear encryptions using CBC can be broken. Further, we show that no linear cipher (such as a permutation or XOR cipher) is safe when used in conjunction with the mode and that non-linear ciphers (such as AES) are also vulnerable. Using the Birthday Paradox to predict how much data is needed to allow for decryption. This talk will demonstrate the break and show the mathematical background of the attack.

          <td>Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies have become a very big deal since its inception in January 2009 when the very first transaction was recorded to the blockchain. Since this time multiple other crypto-currencies have come into existence, an entire crypto-currency market has been created and the technology is making waves in the overall economy. <br/><br/>
          
          As with all technology it can be used for good or bad and Bitcoin is no different. The technology has grown in popularity and many people desire to use it in a secure, anonymous manner that would make it difficult to identify them. One option would be the use of a Bitcoin Tumbler. This tool was created because every Bitcoin transaction is written to a public ledger called the blockchain. Anyone can track Bitcoins as they are transferred between addresses.<br/><br/>
          
          When used properly the process of tumbling Bitcoin may increase your chances of remaining anonymous. This tool is useful to people looking to maintain their privacy, those who may be in restrictive countries or someone looking to make a purchase without it being tracked back to them. It also may be used to launder stolen Bitcoins, make illegal purchases or avoid leaving the paper trail found with traditional currencies.</td>

Partly as a consequence of these attacks, and partly motivated by stronger security theorems for the web, Karthik is loosely involved with the TLS working group in the design on TLS 1.3.  Karthik was trained at IIT New Delhi and the University of Pennsylvania. Before coming to Paris in 2009, he worked as a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England for several years.</td>
          <td>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol suffers from legacy bloat: after 20 years of evolution, it features many versions, extensions, and ciphersuites, some of which are obsolete and known to be insecure. Implementations and deployments of TLS deal with this complexity by implementing composite state machines that allow new and old features to coexist for interoperability, while waiting for deprecated features to be disabled over time. Getting this composition right is tricky, and any flaw can result in a serious attack that bypasses the expected security of TLS.<br/><br/>
          
          This talk will discuss three recent vulnerabilities discovered in our group: SKIP uses state machine flaws in Oracle’s JSSE to hijack TLS connections between a Java client and any web server; FREAK uses legacy support for export-grade RSA cipher suites to break into connections between mainstream browsers and 25% of the web; Logjam exploits a protocol flaw to confuse DHE key exchanges into using export-grade Diffie-Hellman groups. These attacks rely on a combination of protocol-level weaknesses, implementation bugs, and weak cryptography. The talk will advocate principled methods to avoid such weaknesses in the future, such as software verification and new robust designs for new protocols like TLS 1.3.
