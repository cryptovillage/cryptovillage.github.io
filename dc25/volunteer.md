## Volunteer Info

Running CPV at DC25 in Las Vegas July 28-30, 2017 would not be possible without volunteers. So this is a shoutout for all, who would be interested to contribute their time to this event.

This year we have changed things a bit. There will be 3 roles for volunteering

- Info desk
- Speaker ops
- Crowd control

which all have its own important role to make CPV successful. All volunteers who signup for 2 shifts or more will get

- Cool volunteer shirt
- Special CPV volunteer badge (not equivalent to defcon badge)
- Other swag we may come up with

Volunteers are needed July 27-30, 2017.

Volunteer signup opens begin of July.
