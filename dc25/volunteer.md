## Volunteer Info

The Crypto & Privacy Village would not be possible without volunteers. <br />
Thank you to all of our volunteers for helping make the Crypto & Privacy Village at DEF CON possible! 

We are currently looking for volunteers for the CPV @ DEF CON 25 (July 27-30, 2017).

We've changed the format a bit. There are 3 volunteer roles 3:

- Info desk
- Speaker ops
- Crowd control

Each play an important and vital role to make CPV successful. All volunteers who signup for 2 shifts or more will receive:

- A volunteer t-shirt
- Special CPV volunteer badge (not equivalent to defcon badge)
- Potentially other cool swag

Volunteers are needed July 27-30, 2017.

**Volunteer signup opens early July.**
